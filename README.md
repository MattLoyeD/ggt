"One page to rule them all."

The idea : Making a tab on all your devices with everything you want to know and your common links such as email or social networks.

The goal : Reduce 10 tabs in 1, i don't want to open everything, specially on my smartphone when i'm travelling.

Feel free to use this work and improve, i've made it just for my use at start, then i realised it could be usefull to other.



Wanna help me ?
