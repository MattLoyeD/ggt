"One page to rule them all."

The idea : Making a tab on all your devices with everything you want to know and your common links such as email or social networks.

The goal : Reduce 10 tabs in 1, i don't want to open everything, specially on my smartphone when i'm travelling.

Feel free to use this work and improve, i've made it just for my use at start, then i realised it could be usefull to other.



Wanna help me ?

TODO List :
-----------

- Making a cache system for RSS (if two users have a.xml, we don't need to parse 2 time each refresh but one time each 2 minutes).
- Making a logo and improve design.
- Making an how to use.
- Making an highlighter for seeing wich title appeared in last 3 / 10 / 30 / 60 minutes etc. It's to easy readability.
- Link with Google OAuth.
- Making a "Tell a friend"
- Getting sleep.
